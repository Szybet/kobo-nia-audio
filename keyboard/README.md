updated demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz1CcqDgtQU

it's the [platinet K120](https://sklep.platinet.pl/pl/p/Klawiatura-Platinet-K120-US/7711) with a full custom case, some m4 screws for hinges, many magnets and some custom cables to make it work

To make the keyboard quiter, I used [silicone grease](https://www.tecmaxx.pl/produkty/smar-silikonowy/) under the "butterfly" caps, and removed metal wires under bigger buttons. Also some regular black silicone to all gaps.

"Sister" repos:
- https://github.com/Szybet/FeatherNotes-inkbox - The app modified and used for this purpuse. Cool app
- https://github.com/Szybet/Charger-controller - used with IPD ( 10-chargerController), It's the program launched at the beggining of the video. Set's the current and changes mode to host. WARNING: Works only on the Nia A model, anyway could burn your device down
- https://github.com/Szybet/feather-joplin-bridge - Description in the name
- https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/qt5-kobo-platform-plugin - Modified for keyboard and **mouse** support
